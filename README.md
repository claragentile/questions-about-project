# questions-about-project
Hello, 

We had talked during exercice session about our project, we are group 6 and we had problems with dynamics and dynamics_async. We tried debugging the code but we can't seem to find the problem, and you had suggested to create a git hub repository if we could not solve the problem within the next few days. If we can't find find the problem, we can't go forward with the rest of the project.
The specifics of the problem:
we never obtain convergence, we never have the same at the end, and we don't understand why. We might have changed some things about the code becuase we were debugging, so if there are abnormalities in the rest of the code, that is why. 

Thank you so much!
Valentine, Clara and Alexandra
